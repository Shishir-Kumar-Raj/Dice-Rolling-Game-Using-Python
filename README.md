# Dice-Rolling-Game-Using-Python

This Python program is a straightforward command-line **Dice Rolling Game** that mimics the action of rolling a standard six-sided die. Upon execution, it greets the user and continuously asks whether they would like to roll the dice by entering "y" or "n". If the user responds with **'y'**, the program uses the `random.randint()` function to produce a number between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll, and then displays the result. If the user types **'n'**, the game ends with a farewell message. Any other response is treated as invalid, prompting the user accordingly. The loop repeats until the user decides to quit. This game is ideal for beginners and helps reinforce fundamental Python concepts like loops, conditionals, user input processing, and the use of the `random` module.
